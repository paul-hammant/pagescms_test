## The Three Laws of Robotics

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
2. A robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law
